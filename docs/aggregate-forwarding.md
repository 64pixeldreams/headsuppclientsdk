# Aggregate Forwarding

`AGGREGATE_FORWARD` turns Heads Up into an aggregation gateway. Instead of forwarding every raw event, Heads Up folds events into time buckets and sends one webhook when a bucket is closed.

Use it when another system wants clean summaries for analytics, billing, reporting, dashboards, enrichment jobs, or product workflows that should not receive the raw event firehose.

Canonical API documentation lives in the main API repo: <https://github.com/64pixeldreams/headsuppapp/blob/main/docs/api/aggregate-forwarding.md>.

## Supported Bucket Types

Heads Up currently supports:

```text
minute
hour
day
week
month
```

Bucket boundaries are UTC. Week buckets start at 00:00 UTC on Monday. Month buckets start at 00:00 UTC on the first day of the month.

`quarter` and `year` are not supported bucket types today. Forward monthly buckets and roll them up downstream if quarterly or yearly reporting is needed.

## Aggregate Values

Aggregate-forward payloads can include:

```text
sum
count
avg
min
max
last
```

These values are calculated from event `value.num`.

## SDK Example

Create an aggregate-forward subscriber:

```js
const aggregateSubscriber = await headsup.createSubscriber({
  workspace_id: workspace.workspace_id,
  channel_id: channel.channel_id,
  subscriber_type: 'webhook',
  destination_url: 'https://example.com/headsupp/aggregates',
  display_name: 'Aggregate callback',
  mode: 'aggregate_forward',
  config: {
    signing_secret: process.env.HEADSUPP_AGGREGATE_SIGNING_SECRET,
  },
});
```

Create an aggregate-forward watch:

```js
await headsup.createWatch({
  workspace_id: workspace.workspace_id,
  channel_id: channel.channel_id,
  signal_id: signalResult.signal.signal_id,
  name: 'Forward hourly aggregate',
  watch_type: 'AGGREGATE_FORWARD',
  config: {
    bucket_type: 'hour',
    emit_after_grace_seconds: 60,
    subscriber_id: aggregateSubscriber.subscriber_id,
    include: {
      sum: true,
      count: true,
      avg: true,
      min: true,
      max: true,
      last: true,
    },
  },
});
```

## Callback Payload

Heads Up sends a `POST` request to the subscriber `destination_url`:

```json
{
  "source": "heads_up",
  "event_type": "aggregate_bucket_closed",
  "signal_key": "website.form.views",
  "workspace_id": "ws_demo",
  "channel_id": "ch_demo",
  "bucket": {
    "type": "hour",
    "start_at": "2026-05-26T10:00:00.000Z",
    "end_at": "2026-05-26T11:00:00.000Z"
  },
  "dimensions_hash": "d8f0b2c1",
  "dimensions": {
    "source": "paid_search",
    "form_id": "quote_form"
  },
  "values": {
    "sum": 428,
    "count": 428,
    "avg": 1,
    "min": 1,
    "max": 1,
    "last": 1
  },
  "delivery_id": "aggdel_abc123",
  "dedupe_key": "sub_report_aggregates:sig_form_views:hour:2026-05-26T10:00:00.000Z:d8f0b2c1"
}
```

Signed delivery headers are included when the subscriber has `config.signing_secret` or the API Worker has `OUTBOUND_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET`.
